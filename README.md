Querydex is a rails app in progress that takes data from the pokedex and will allow the user to perform queries on it. Right now the data only goes up to Gen V Pokemon, though that may change.

Species info comes from: (corpora)[https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/games/pokemon.json]
Type info comes from: (iPokedex-DB) [https://github.com/UberGames/iPokedex-DB/blob/e2404d23aa137e1b8b160eaf5b70efe8f784e462/csv/elemental_types.csv]
