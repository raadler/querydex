Querydex is a rails app in progress that takes data from the Pokedex and will allow the user to perform queries on it. Right now the data only goes up to Gen V Pokemon, though that may change.

Species info comes from [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora)

Type info comes from [iPokedex-DB](https://github.com/UberGames/iPokedex-DB/)
